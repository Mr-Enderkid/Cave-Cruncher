To run the game, simply open one of the executable files in your operating system (you'll most likely have to use the terminal as this is a text-based game).

Or you can just run the "main.py" (with all other files in the same folder) in your editor of choice and enjoy the game! There's a few little bugs to iron out for now but I hope you enjoy! The game is still a tiiiny bit buggy but enjoy!
(Help me this is confusing)
